##Overview of Steps
Here is a brief overview of how we achieved tidyData.txt:

### Data set names created from Import:
1. testdata
2. traindata
3. testY
4. trainY
5. subtest
6. subtrain
7. features
8. activities

### Description of Procedures:
1. Combination of testdata and traindata sets using rbind
2. gsub & tolower to tidy names
3. Subset with grep to extract mean and stanrdard Deviation columns
4. Use cbind to update combined data with tidy names and the data we want
5. Bind subtest and subtrain sets with rbind
6. rbind testY and trainY sets
7. Use SQL to update acvity code 
8. bind all manipluated/cleaned data sets
9. Melt all data
10. Cast means
11. Export tidydataset with write.csv

##Variable Info from dataset[1]

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

### The Course Project only uses mean and std calculations
